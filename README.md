# Predicting Credit Scores

## Background
For this research project, the problem I aimed to address was the accurate prediction of credit scores based on customer credit information and history. 

Credit scores are a crucial factor in determining an individualâ€™s financial health, and lenders heavily rely on them to assess creditworthiness and risk. However, credit score calculations can be complex and multifaceted, taking into account a range of factors such as payment history, outstanding debts, credit utilization, and length of credit history. My goals was to build a reliable model that can accurately classify credit scores based on customer information, providing lenders with a tool to make more informed decisions and ultimately helping individuals to secure better financial outcomes.
