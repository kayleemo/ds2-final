# Predicting Credit Scores

## Background
For this research project, the problem I aimed to address was the accurate prediction of credit scores based on customer credit information and history. 

Credit scores are a crucial factor in determining an individualâ€™s financial health, and lenders heavily rely on them to assess creditworthiness and risk. However, credit score calculations can be complex and multifaceted, taking into account a range of factors such as payment history, outstanding debts, credit utilization, and length of credit history. My goals was to build a reliable model that can accurately classify credit scores based on customer information, providing lenders with a tool to make more informed decisions and ultimately helping individuals to secure better financial outcomes.

As of right now, I have only learned classification models with binary classification. The credit scores are classified into Poor, Standard, and Good on our dataset. Because of this, I assigned random credit ratings to those with Poor credit scores (ratings from 300-629), those with Standard (ratings from 630-689), and Good (ratings from 690-719) in order to create regression models and pursue a continuous response.
